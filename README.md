# RPCS-22-HW
Rapid Prototyping of Computer Systems Spring 2022 

This repository contains code produced by various teams in the Spring 2022 semester.

The teams are the following: Infrastructure-Sensing, Kiosk, Personal Systems

Below is the description of the different subprojects that each team worked on.

## Infrastructure-Sensing

Using two Raspberry Pi devices interfaced with a variety of sensors, we collected data on the roads around Pittsburgh for object detection (i.e. cones) and bumpy roads (i.e. potholes).

## Kiosk

Using a desktop computer, monitor, keyboard, and other peripherals, we designed a kiosk that could be placed around Pittsburgh for users to access information about transportation.

## Personal Systems

Using a Raspberry Pi interfaced with sensors, we designed a system that could be attached to a wheelchair or scooter in order to gain more information about roads and sidewalks for personal transportation.
